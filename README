This R package provides a single procedure `guix.install`, which
allows R users to install R packages via Guix right from within their
running R session.

If the requested R package does not exist in Guix at this time, the
package and all its missing dependencies will be imported recursively
and the generated package definitions will be written to
`~/.Rguix/packages.scm`.  This record of imported packages can be used
later to reproduce the environment, and to add the packages in
question to a proper Guix channel (or Guix itself).

`guix.install` not only supports installing packages from CRAN, but
also from Bioconductor or even arbitrary git or mercurial
repositories, replacing the need for installation via devtools.

# Hacking

Use [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) to enter a suitable development
environment and build the package:

```shell
guix shell
R CMD build .
R CMD check --as-cran guix.install_1.0.0.tar.gz
```
